## Purpose & background

* The purpose of this project is to show my understanding and competence regarding webdevelopment using JavaSript, HTML and CSS.

This site is design as a presentation and it's function is that the visitor gets in contact with the company to get more information so the company gets potential leads.

Starting with the sticky navigation bar at the top that follows the visitor down through the page for quick and easy navigation through the website. The navigation bar also has a hover function which highlights the current position with a underline. This hover-function also appears on the contact form and in the footer on the social media links.

The site has a "reveal function" which makes the different sections , which initially ar hidden, appear while scolling down. 

In the contact seciton the is a contact-button which activates a pop-up window with a contact-form.

## Site Structure

This site contains one page. Using the navigaton bar it takes the visitor to designated sections of this page. As it's main function is to get the visitor to make contact with the company I've made it to a very clean site with highlight on the contactbutton.

### *Top of page*
The visitor "lands" on the page and is immediately welcomed by a big picture on solar panels.
