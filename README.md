## Site Structure

This site contains one page. Using the navigaton bar it takes the visitor to designated sections of this page. As it's main function is to get the visitor to make contact with the company I've made it to a very clean site with highlight on the contactbutton.

The visitor "lands" on the page and is immediately welcomed by a big picture on solar panels. Scrolling down I've listed some simple to understand messages in to why you should install solar-panels on you roof.

Continue scolling down the page the "make contact area" appears. Highlighted is the contact-button which has a contast color and clicking it takes the visitor to a pop-up window containing a contactform.

Below the contact area is a slideshow containng six images rolling automaticlly with the interval of 4 seconds. This serves as a gallery and "get inspired" area.

Scolling down the visitor sees some more information if they wish to call or even visit the company.

At the bottom of the page there's a footer containing links to socail media.
